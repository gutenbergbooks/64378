<h2>Sandzen and His Friend, the Smoky.</h2>

<p>When Birger Sandzen looks into the seamed face of a pioneer farmer of
Kansas, he sees the conquest of a spirit. When he looks upon the face of
the Kansas prairie, he sees the conquest of the Wilderness and he makes
the World feel the courage of the Kansas spirit and the power of Kansas
sinews.</p>

<p>An artist who penetrates below the surface of his subject and sees the
soul of it looking out, Birger Sandzen Was foreordained to celebrate in
black and white and in color, the moods and the meaning of the Smoky
Hill River, which winds so peacefully in and out among the farms of
central Kansas.</p>

<p>The Smoky Hill River is not much wider than a creek, and the early
homesteader valued it chiefly because it watered his land and his stock.</p>

<p>Then came Birger Sandzen, artist, who settled near the stream in the
town of Lindsborg. Almost immediately a deep affection sprang up between
the artist and the river. Accustomed to a land of many streams and
lakes, the artist haunted the banks of the river that seemed to speak to
him of home. He served the friendly stream by celebrating its moods and
sudden turnings, and the stream taught the artist by gentle gradations
its own affinity for the prairie.</p>

<p>It was so that Birger Sandzen learned to love the Kansas landscape. But
first he sought the shadowed banks of the Smoky. By sunlight and
moonlight he studied it. Following its graceful windings, he caught the
poetry of Kansas,&mdash;the tired droop of cattle as they came to drink at
dusk, the grouping of horses in hillside pastures, huddled cottonwoods
like shy children along the clean banks of the stream.</p>

<p>Finally the river taught him to see the masterpieces of art in the
strong and rugged faces of the pioneer farmers whose land stretched
along the river’s bank.</p>

<p>He saw faces in which courage had drawn with a true hand lines of
self-conquest. He saw the beauty of fingers knotted and bent with much
serving and the glory of dimmed eyes. The pioneer men and women of
Kansas were crowned by Sandzen with the splendor of their deeds.</p>

<p>But always he returned to the quiet river, grateful for the woods that
hugged its banks and were mirrored in the water. His passion for the
Smoky grew and deepened. It became to him the heart of Kansas, and
Kansas, through the Smoky, became his friend.</p>

<p>And always, as he tramped up and down the river’s banks, he saw in
miniature the grandeur he was later on to find in the Rockies and the
mastery he was to sense in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.</p>

<p>As he painted outcroppings of rock in the hilly pastures, he was
preparing unconsciously for his work of giving expression to the
gigantic cliffs and mountains of the great West. Tributaries of the
Smoky, overflowing their banks in the spring freshets, ran dry in summer
and provided the artist with beds deeply fissured like their titanic
model, the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>The hills near Lindsborg, are small replicas of the Rockies. They slope
to the very bank of the Smoky and Birger Sandzen climbed from bank to
summit where he looked out over the wide prairie and saw how lovely it
was.</p>

<p>Since then he has never tired of painting the landscape that is the
heart of Kansas, vibrating with the heroic toil and patience of the past
and the hope of the future.</p>

<p>Thus it is that when Mr. Sandzen makes a study of the moon stealing up
behind the willows before the flush of afternoon is quite gone, he puts
into the picture not only the objects a stranger might see, but also the
deep love he bears the river and the land it has enriched.</p>

<p>As a lithographer Mr. Sandzen has no rivals in this country, perhaps
none anywhere. His love of the open is that of a poet, to whom the
out-of-doors tells something of the immanence of God.</p>

<p>Sometimes his landscapes express the poignant loneliness that broods
over the Kansas prairie. Oftener he sees the delightful homeliness of
the farmsteads, changing the Smoky River Valley from a wilderness to a
place of hearthstones and human happiness.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
